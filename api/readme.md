## Tech Stack

Bagelbot is, in essence, an api endpoint for the `Bagelbot` slackbot to interact with. Bagelbot, as an entity, is managed by Slack through the [Bagelbot Slack Management](https://api.slack.com/apps/A03K7ABEX4K) page. We can further define functionality through specified endpoints. This project is the endpoint the bot interacts with.

| Sector            | Technology                                            | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API Language      | [typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript) | Type safety and seamless integration with other technologies in this project                                                                                                                  |
| API Framework     | [express](https://npmjs.com/package/express)          | Middleware-based routing model, plus general familiarity                                                                                                                                      |
| Bagelbot Database | [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/)                   | Mostly to spite `@galen.guyer`, but also familiarity with the [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) modeling tool. Bagelbot implements a fixed-schema data set, despite mongodb. |
| GQL Client        | [urql](https://npmjs.com/package/urql)                | Lightweight alternative to apollo. Limited gql functionality is needed for this project                                                                                                       |

## Deployment Lifecycle

To deploy changes to the `bagelbot.erwijet.com` endpoint for testing in the `#bagelbot-playground`, follow these steps.

### Build New Image

1. Make sure docker is running
2. run `yarn deploy`. This will build and push the new image to `bb.cr.erwijet.com:5001`.

### Redeploy Pods

Note that when a pod is killed/restarted, it's replacement will always use the newest image on https://bb.cr.erwijet.com.

There are two options here. The first is to run the `/bbadmin kill pod` (or `/bbadmin kp` for short) command in slack, and bagelbot will kill the running pod. You can check when the pod is back online by navigating to https://bagelbot.erwijet.com/healthcheck. If the result is 404 for 502, then the pod isn't ready yet.

Otherwise, assuming you have a valid `~/.kube/config` file with the correct Roles to interact with the bagelbot kubernetes namespace, you can run the following commands `kubectl rollout restart deployment bagelbot-deployment -n bagelbot`

### Console Monitoring

You may often need to inspect the console output of the live code running at bagelbot.erwijet.com (the version that actually interacts with the slack workspace). Although you can get a lot of information debugging in localhost, a lot of debugging also needs to happen in an actual slack enviornment. To view these logs, you will need a Portainer login. Just slack @tyler and he can set one up for you. Once you have your username and password, go to https://portainer.csh.erwijet.com and sign in. Then, go to the `cassiopeia.erwijet.com` enviornment, click `namespaces` -> `bagelbot` -> `bagelbot-deployment` and at the bottom click `logs`.

Otherwise, you can always use `watch -d -n 1 "kubectl get pods -n bagelbot --no-headers | awk '/bagelbot/{print \$1}' | xargs kubectl logs -n bagelbot"` to view the logs of the current pod if you have `kubectl` set up for the bagelbot namespace.

### Rollout Command

If you are on a mac and have `kubectl` configured, you can install `watch` with `brew install watch` and execute the entire deployment process (build, push, restart, wait for healthcheck) with `yarn rollout` and wait for the healthcheck to show 'OK'.
