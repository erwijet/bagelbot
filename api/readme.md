# Enviornment Variable Requirements

Running an instance of `bagelbotdev/api` requires the following enviornment variables specified, typically in a top-level `.env` file.

| Name               | Purpose                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MONGO_URL`        | The mongodb connection string with credentials specified                                 |
| `COIN_ENDPOINT`    | The coin api endpoint to interact with. Typically, this is http://bryxcoin01.csh.rit.edu |
| `SLACKBOT_WEBHOOK` | The webhook to interact with when sending messages to slack channels                     |

Slack `@tyler` with any questions or for access credentials.

## Tech Stack

| Sector            | Technology                                            | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API Language      | [typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript) | Type safety and seamless integration with other technologies in this project                                                                                                                  |
| API Framework     | [express](https://npmjs.com/package/express)          | Middleware-based routing model, plus general familiarity                                                                                                                                      |
| Bagelbot Database | [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/)                   | Mostly to spite `@galen.guyer`, but also familiarity with the [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) modeling tool. Bagelbot implements a fixed-schema data set, despite mongodb. |
| GQL Client        | [urql](https://npmjs.com/package/urql)                | Lightweight alternative to apollo. Limited gql functionality is needed for this project                                                                                                       |

## Deployment Steps for bagelbot.erwijet.com

The production enviornment is not tied to github CI/CD. The purpose of this, is that often times chagnes need to be tested before committing. In the furture, we may have a speerate bot that acts as a "staging" enviornment, but it is nearly impossible to replicate a staging slack enviornment for development. As such, the production enviornment acts as a staging enviornment.

Production deployment prerequisites:

1. The `yarn`, `kubectl`, and `docker` cli tools are all installed and accessable in `$PATH`.
2. Your local container runtime is up.
3. You have access to the underlying kubernetes cluster (specifed in your local `~/.kube/config`)
4. You are logged in to the relevant container registry. You can do this with `docker login ghcr.io/bagelbotdev`

Once you have confirmed you meet the prereqs, you can deploy the current working version of the codebase to production with `yarn rollout` which will automatically perform the following steps:

1. Build the current version of the codebase into an image tagged with `:latest`.
2. Push the newly created image to the container registry.
3. Restartes the kubernetes api deployment which will trigger an image re-pull.
4. Executes a healthcheck probe twice a second to check when the deployment is back online. When the response changes from `404 not found` or `Bad Gateway` to `OK`, the deployment is complete!
